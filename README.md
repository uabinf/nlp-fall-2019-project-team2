## Duplicate Question Pair Detection in Natural Language Processing
By Raiful Hasan and Mohammad Aminul Hoque 

Identifying the duplicate questions is challenging, the sentence composition and word selection vary among persons. 
There is a way to find the document similarity based on the degree of overlapping in classic natural language processing. 
However, in duplicate question detection, it not perform well, because most of the questions are too small and the degree 
of overlapping is insufficient. We have implemented an LSTM based architecture that will detect the duplicate question if 
they have the same intent.
